==71098== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==71098== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==71098== or are doing some strange experiment):

==71098== 
==71098== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==71098==   /path/to/gdb ./minishell
==71098== and then give GDB the following command
==71098==   target remote | /Users/gchatain/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6ff08b6/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=71098
